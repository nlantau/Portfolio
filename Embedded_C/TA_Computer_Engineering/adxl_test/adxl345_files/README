ADXL345 3-axis Accelerometer AVR Atmega library.
The ADXL345 is a small, thin, low power, 3-axis accelerometer with high
resolution (13-bit) measurement at up to ±16 g. Digital output data is
formatted as 16-bit twos complement and is acces-sible through either
a SPI (3- or 4-wire) or I2C digital interface.

User can setup measurement mode to 2/4/8/16G.
Calibration is suggested to get more accurate paramenters.

Setup parameters are stored in file adxl345.h
