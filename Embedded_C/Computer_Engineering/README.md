# Computer Engineering

During this course the main goal was to design, print, solder and program a remote control that was to (via zigbee-protocol) control an
ATmega328P robot, as a group project.

## Project

My part in the project was mainly the design and soldering of the remote control, along with some protoype software testing. Parts of the
testing and/or actual code is included in this part of my portfolio. The project itself is a separate private repository which of course can
be shown on demand.
