# Lap Counter

This was a pretty fun and quick mini-project I quickly put together a day or two before we held a just-for-fun competition for our students in
the introductory course for engineers.
It came out fairly acurate in timing and worked well, so we used it throughout the entire competition as our main lap counter.

## The Course, overall

The course was not held in C, although I've used it for my mini-project. We used Arduino "IDE" with Arduino language, for the students as it's
a whole lot easier to get started with (compared to embedded C).
