# Info
During our studies, we mainly program embedded C towards the ATmega328P. While
I've got a rather larger amount of code spread out throughout a couple of private
repositories, I've tried to only pic out a very small amount of code to somehow
provide a bit of insight in roughly what I've done.  I'll do my best to not
clutter these portfolio directories.

A great part of what I've learned and the reason behind the way I code is the
ATmega328P documentation and well-defined coding standards (such as MISRA,
BARR-C and NASA C Style Guide). A lot of my embedded C knowledge is gained
through usage of the already mentioned factors as well as by a lot of
discussion with my fellow students. 

The usage of Make is something I've had to figure out by myself, which I'm
quite proud of (regarding makefiles for embedded devices). My go-to Makefile
that I've created is found [here](https://github.com/nlantau/Portfolio/blob/master/Embedded_C/TA_Computer_Engineering/traffic_light/Makefile)
