# Info
During our studies, we mainly program embedded C towards the ATmega328P. While I've got a huge amount of code spread out throughout a couple
of private repositories, I've tried to only pic out a very small amount of code to somehow provide a bit of insight in roughly what I've done.
I'll do my best to not clutter theses portfolio directories.

A great part of what I've learned and the reason behind the way I code is the ATmega328P documentation and well-defined coding standards (such as
MISRA, BARR-C and NASA C Style Guide). A lot of my embedded C knowledge is gained through usage of the already mentioned factors as well as by
a lot of discussion with my fellow students. 

The usage of Make is something I've had to figure out by myself, which I'm quite proud of (regarding makefiles for embedded devices).
