# Python

Here are some scripts that I've created that:
+ Solves various math problems, in calculus, linear algebra and applied mathematics.
+ Uses CSV + matplotlib scripts for plotting various data, such as a Ceasar Cipher script (that compares letter frequencies)
+ Automation scripts for file system (MacOS/\*nix)


More to come!
