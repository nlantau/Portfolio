# Portfolio of Niklas Lantau

Welcome to this portfolio of code!

As of 2022-02-04, I've made some clean up of this repository. It's far from complete still,
such as my Python section. To get some grasp of my (usually) quick and dirty coding challenge
solutions, why not head over to my [Code-Challenges](https://github.com/nlantau/Code-Challenges) repo.

Why install precompiled binaries in no time, when you can compile everything from source?
Glad you asked. [This](https://github.com/nlantau/Gentoo) is my Gentoo configs.

I really enjoy exploring the new and unknown; learning new programming languages, paradigms and algorithms
are some of my top nerdy things I enjoy doing. Flipping bits in a low-level C programs that gets cross-compiled to 8-bit
MCUs are just as fun as learning how combinator logic make point free solutions possible in Haskell and APL. I have a
firm belief that exploring a wide variety of topics outside my comfortable domains make me a better problem solver.


As of 2021-01-28, I've just started to compile this repo as I figured it might
be a pretty good thing to have. I'm in the making and updating of the repo, so
it's a bit of a mess right now. Hopefully, I'll have it structured and
well-representing of me soon.

I'll do my absolute best to not have anything else but my own code in this
repo. If needed, I'll do my best to provide any other authors clearly (for
instance in used libraries). 


Do you find something that I've missed to reference or anything that looks
wrong or whatever, please help me out by notifing me so I can update and/or
clarify the code! I do *not* what do claim any rights to other authors work.


### C - Algorithms and Data Structures
+ Did the majority of the course *Algorithms and Data Structures* in **C**
	+ Used [driver_main.c](https://github.com/nlantau/Portfolio/blob/master/C/Algorithms_and_Data_Structures/Seminar_1_Sorting_Algorithms/C/driver_main.c)
	to start whatever algorithm and/or data structure that was going to be testet
	+ Used [tester.py](https://github.com/nlantau/Portfolio/blob/master/C/Algorithms_and_Data_Structures/Seminar_1_Sorting_Algorithms/Python/Plott_results/tester.py)
	to test `driver_main.c`
	+ More information [here](https://github.com/nlantau/Portfolio/tree/master/C/Algorithms_and_Data_Structures/Seminar_1_Sorting_Algorithms)

### Embedded C
+ TODO

### Python
+ TODO

### Iptables
I implemented an iptables [firewall](https://github.com/nlantau/Portfolio/blob/master/shell-iptables_on_arch/firewall) on Arch Linux
and used MacOS as the "attacker" box. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/nlantau/Portfolio/tree/master/shell-iptables_on_arch)
