# Portfolio of Niklas Lantau

Welcome to this portfolio of code!

As of 2021-01-28, I've just started to compile this repo as I figured it might
be a pretty good thing to have. I'm in the making and updating of the repo, so
it's a bit of a mess right now. Hopefully, I'll have it structured and
well-representing of me soon.

I'll do my absolute best to not have anything else but my own code in this
repo. If needed, I'll do my best to provide any other authors clearly (for
instance in used libraries). 


Do you find something that I've missed to reference or anything that looks
wrong or whatever, please help me out by notifing me so I can update and/or
clarify the code! I do *not* what do claim any rights to other authors work.


### C - Algorithms and Data Structures
+ Did the majority of the course *Algorithms and Data Structures* in **C**
	+ Used [driver_main.c](https://github.com/nlantau/Portfolio/blob/master/C/Algorithms_and_Data_Structures/Seminar_1_Sorting_Algorithms/C/driver_main.c)
	to start whatever algorithm and/or data structure that was going to be testet
	+ Used [tester.py](https://github.com/nlantau/Portfolio/blob/master/C/Algorithms_and_Data_Structures/Seminar_1_Sorting_Algorithms/Python/Plott_results/tester.py)
	to test `driver_main.c`
	+ More information [here](https://github.com/nlantau/Portfolio/tree/master/C/Algorithms_and_Data_Structures/Seminar_1_Sorting_Algorithms)

### Embedded C
+ TODO

### Python
+ TODO

### Iptables
I implemented an iptables [firewall](https://github.com/nlantau/Portfolio/blob/master/shell-iptables_on_arch/firewall) on Arch Linux
and used MacOS as the "attacker" box. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/nlantau/Portfolio/tree/master/shell-iptables_on_arch)
