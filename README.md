# Portfolio of Niklas Lantau

Welcome to this portfolio of code!

As of 2021-01-28, I've just started to compile this repo as I figured it might be a pretty good thing to have. I'm in the making and updating
of the repo, so it's a bit of a mess right now. Hopefully, I'll have it structured and well-representing of me soon.

I'll do my absolute best to not have anything else but my own code in this repo. If needed, I'll do my best to provide any other authors
clearly (for instance in used libraries). 


Do you find something that I've missed to reference or anything that looks wrong or whatever, please help me out by notifing me so I can
update and/or clarify the code! I do *not* what do claim any rights to other authors work.

## TODO
+ Python folder
+ C folder
